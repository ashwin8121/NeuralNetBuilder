# Neural Network Builder - No Code Platform

A no-code, drag-and-drop interface for building and training neural networks using image datasets.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives

- **Simplify Neural Network Construction**: Drag-and-drop UI for creating models without coding.
- **Ensure Flexibility**: Choose custom datasets and architectures beyond typical no-code tools.
- **Enable Integration**: Built with TensorFlow and supports TensorBoard monitoring.

## Tech Stack

- **Python**
- **PyQt6** â€” UI development
- **TensorFlow** â€” Model training
- **TensorBoard** â€” Training visualization

## App Structure

- **Builder Page**: Design your neural network.
- **Dataset Page**: Upload and manage image datasets.
- **Monitor Page**: Visualize training with TensorBoard.

##  Notes

- Works with **image datasets** only.
- Designed for users without deep ML or coding experience.
